                The project would probably cost Â£200m or more, but the idea is that it would be funded commercially.

              mission', commercially, like this before. It's a new model and would be
              paving the way for how we do space in the future."

              Details are sparse at the moment. No crew has been chosen, nor is there a concept yet for how it would
              be selected.
